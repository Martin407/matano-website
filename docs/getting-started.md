## Deployment

To get started with Matano, run the `matano init` command. Make sure you have AWS credentials in your environment (or in a an AWS CLI profile).

The interactive CLI wizard will walk you through getting started by generating an initial [Matano directory](./matano-directory.md) for you, initializing your AWS account, and deploying Matano into your AWS account.

Initial deployment takes a few minutes.
