The Snyk Matano managed log source lets you ingest your Snyk [Audit logs](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/audit-logs/get-list-of-issues) and [vulnerabilty issues](https://snyk.docs.apiary.io/#reference/reporting-api/issues/get-list-of-issues).

## Usage

Use the managed log source by specifying the `managed.type` property in your `log_source` as `SNYK`.

```yml
name: snyk

managed:
  type: SNYK
  properties:
    group_id: <MY_GROUP_ID>
    org_id: <MY_ORG_ID>
```

Then create tables for each of the Snyk logs you want to ingest. For example, if you want to ingest Snyk audit logs, as well vulnerabilities, create table files like so:

```
my-matano-dir/
└── log_sources/
    └── snyk/
        └── log_source.yml
        └── tables/
            └── audit.yml
            └── vulnerabilities.yml
            └── ...
```

```yml
# log_sources/snyk/tables/audit.yml
name: audit
```

For a complete reference on configuring log sources, including extending the table schema, see [_Log source configuration_](../configuration.md).

## Tables

The Snyk managed log source supports the following tables:

- audit
- vulnerabilities

## Ingest

### Pull (default)

Matano integrates with your Snyk account to automatically pull relevant logs on a regular basis (every 24 hrs).

To get started with the integration, specify the following properties in the log source configuration file:

```yml
managed:
  type: SNYK
  properties:
    group_id: <MY_GROUP_ID>
    org_id: <MY_ORG_ID>
```

After the first deployment, this log source will also generate a secret in AWS secret's manager to store secrets related to this integration.

#### Secret

To finish onboarding the log source, populate the `api_token` key in the secret generated by Matano in AWS Secrets Manager, with the value of your Snyk API token.

## Schema

Snyk log data is normalized to ECS fields. Custom fields are normalized into the `snyk` field. You can view the [complete mapping][1] to see the full schema.
