Matano managed log sources are common log sources for which Matano provides preconfigured normalizations, transformations, and schemas. This lets you easily ingest logs from a supported log source without having to write a transformation, specify a schema.

## Using managed log sources

To use a Matano managed log source, specify the `managed.type` property in your `log_source.yml` with the corresponding identifier for the managed log source. There is then no need to specify fields like `transform` or `schema` as these will be applied automatically by the managed log source.

For example, to use the CloudTrail managed log source, your `log_source.yml` may look as follows:

```yml
name: "aws_cloudtrail"

managed:
  type: "AWS_CLOUDTRAIL"
```

Managed log sources may also specify additional properties for custom configuration. You may provide this in the `managed.properties` key in your `log_source.yml`. Consult the log source specific documentation for the values to provide, if any.
