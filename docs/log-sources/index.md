title: Log sources
---

To store your data in Matano, you work with log sources. A *log source* represents log data from a specific source.

To ingest data into Matano, you create a log source and define where the data comes from and details like the schema of the log source. You can either use a *Matano managed log source*, where Matano will automatically transform and map your data for you, or a *custom log source*, where you specify the schema and transformation to normalize your log source.

Data from your log sources is ingested into *Matano tables* that you can then view and query, create realtime detections on the log data, and consume the table as a streaming data source.

The topics in this section provide an overview of working with log sources in Matano. They include information about defining, creating, and using log sources.
