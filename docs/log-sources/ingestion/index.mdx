Matano supports ingesting logs from a variety of source types such as Amazon S3 and SQS. Log sources can be configured to use a default Matano provided resource (e.g. bucket) for ingestion, or a custom source can be setup that allows you to *bring your own* (**BYO**) pre-existing resources, and connect them to Matano for log ingestion.

## Supported ingestion source types

The following are the the ingestion source types currently supported by Matano.  Click through to view specific documentation for each log source type.
